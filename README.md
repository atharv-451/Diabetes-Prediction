## Overview

The project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on various health-related features using the PIMA Diabetes Dataset. It involves data analysis, preprocessing, training a Support Vector Machine model, and evaluating its performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/atharv-451/Diabetes-Prediction.git
    cd diabetes-prediction
    ```

## Usage

Execute the Jupyter notebook `diabetes_prediction.ipynb` to run the entire project. Ensure that you have the necessary dataset (`diabetes.csv`) in the project directory.

## Model Performance

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 78.66% on the training data and 77.27% on the test data.

## Making Predictions

You can make predictions using the trained model by providing input data. Check the "Making a Predictive System" section in the notebook for an example.
